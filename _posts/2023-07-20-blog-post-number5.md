## Using R for data science:

#### what your current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science - do you think youâ€™ll continue to use R going forward? Why or why not?)

R is a powerful language for data analysis and statistical modeling.

## Things to do differently in practice now:

Version Control: Start using Git to track changes in code and
collaborate with others. This will help manage projects more effectively
and avoid potential issues with code management.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Placing greater emphasis on data
cleaning and preprocessing. Data quality is crucial for accurate and
reliable analysis, so investing time in understanding and addressing
data issues.

Parallel Computing: We working with big data (like claims data) so,
parallel processing techniques will make the most of computing
resources.

Machine Learning Model Selection: When working with machine learning
models, I now have more practice with model evaluation and selection
techniques. This will help avoid overfitting, consider using
cross-validation, and exploring different algorithms to find the best
model.

## what areas of statistics/data science are you thinking about exploring further?

Learning Natural Language Processing techniques to analyze and process
text data.

Big Data Processing: This will enable you to handle large datasets that
may not fit in memory. Building off parallel processing.

Time Series Analysis: Explore time series modeling and forecasting
techniques.

Bayesian Statistics: Learn Bayesian modeling to incorporate prior
knowledge and uncertainty in your analyses.

My understanding is that R has packages that allow R to handle these
areas of statistics.
