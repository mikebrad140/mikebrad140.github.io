### what would you do differently?

I think I was too worried about automating the code and should have
waiting longer to finish all the modeling before waiting to automate (as
the instructions specified!).

### what was the most difficult part for you?

The automation part was tricky for me. The notes were helpful, but
making sure the render code linked to the .RMD file was the part I
struggled with. In particular making sure the params were correct.
Additionally, I kept thinking I was doing something wrong becuase I was
expecting the models to do a better job at modeling the shares variable.
It took me awhile to convince myself that the predictors are simply
fairly weak at predicting shares. I thought the tree models would be
significantly better than they were.

### what are your big take-aways from this project?

The automation of markdown reports in the biggest thing I will take away
from this project.

Additionally, I thought the models were all pretty similar in predicting
the shares variable, which was a little disappointing.
