## Blog Post 1: ST558 Comparison of Statistician to Data Scientist

What do you think being a data scientist is about?  What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?  What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?  How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?

Data scientists and statisticians share similarities in that both involve working with data and applying statistical techniques to solve problems. However, data science seems to require a broader range of skillsets including computer programming, machine learning, and statistics. Statistics makes up a large part of data science, but a data scientist specializes in applying statistics to real world problems. They do this through processing large scale datasets and generating actionable insights. Data scientists seem to prefer machine learning and predictive modeling approaches, while a statistician will focus on mathematical ideas like significance testing. 

As a research public health analyst at RTI International with expertise in SAS and some R programming experience, I have a strong foundation in statistical analysis.  I routinely work on tasks involving data cleaning, exploratory analysis, statistical modeling, and data visualization, which seems to align well with both data science and statistics. 

I hope to gain more experience through my coursework while incorporating science techniques into my current work. I could see myself transitioning into more of a data science role as I learn more programming and machine learning techniques.
