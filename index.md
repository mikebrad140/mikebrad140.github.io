# Introduction

Hello, readers! Welcome to my blog, where I share my musings on life, statistics, and fatherhood. My name is Michael Bradshaw, and I am a full-time data analyst at RTI International, a part-time graduate student at NCSU, and a proud dad of two wonderful girls.

# About Me

I have always had a passion for data analysis, and working as a data analyst allows me to delve into the fascinating world of numbers, patterns, and insights. At RTI International, I have the opportunity to apply statistical methods and techniques to real-world problems, contributing to evidence-based decision-making.

In parallel to my professional journey, I am pursuing a graduate degree in statistics at NCSU. This academic pursuit not only deepens my understanding of statistical concepts but also opens up new avenues for research and collaboration.

# Life as a Dad

Being a father is one of the most rewarding and fulfilling roles in my life. My two girls bring immense joy and laughter to our home. From the everyday adventures to the special moments, I cherish every opportunity to be a part of their growth and development.

Recently, we had an amazing trip to Disney World. It was a magical experience to witness the excitement and wonder in my girls' eyes as they explored the enchanting world of Disney characters and rides.

Here's a picture at our recent trip to Disney World:
