# Introduction

Hello, world! Welcome to my blog, where I share my musings on life, statistics, and fatherhood. My name is Michael Bradshaw, and I am a full-time data analyst at RTI International, a part-time graduate student at NCSU, and a proud dad of two wonderful girls.

# About Me
I have always had a passion for data, and working as an analyst allows me to delve into this world. At RTI International, I have the opportunity to apply statistical methods and techniques to real-world problems.

In my professional journey, I am pursuing a graduate degree in statistics at NCSU. This will allow a deeper understanding of statistical concepts and hopefully opens up new avenues for research and collaboration.

# Life as a Dad

Being a father is one of the most rewarding and fulfilling roles in my life. My two girls bring immense joy to our family. Recently, we had an amazing trip to Disney World. It was a magical experience to witness their excitement and wonder.

Here's a picture at our recent trip to Disney World:

In this blog, I aim to share my insights and reflections on various aspects of life, statistics, and fatherhood. Some of the topics I plan to cover include:

1. Statistical techniques and their applications in different fields  
2. Balancing work, studies, and family life  
3. Tips and experiences related to parenting and raising children  

I hope you find these blog posts informative, entertaining, and relatable. Stay tuned for updates as I navigate through the chapters of my life!
